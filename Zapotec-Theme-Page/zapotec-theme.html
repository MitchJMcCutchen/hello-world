                    <h1>CARITINA'S LOVE LANGUAGE</h1>
                    <h3>By Barbara Coots</h3>
                    <p>
                        Caritina Gutierrez has never been to school, and she doesn't  
                        understand much Spanish. But she takes great joy in communicating 
                        in Zapotec, her mother tongue.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Most mornings, after preparing for the day, this mother of seven 
                        opens the tall, red wooden doors of her palm-roofed home in 
                        the Oaxacan village of San Blas Atempa. She sits on the wall 
                        outside. Motorcabs, pedestrians and vagrant dogs pass by. She 
                        watches, she smiles at people ... and she prays.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Given the opportunity, she will share the Gospel with those who 
                        stop to speak with her.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        "Very frequently when I come over, there is a lady sitting there 
                        crying with her," says her son, Rolando. "Many people come to 
                        my mother for counsel."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Caritina carries a New Testament in Zapotec. "God speaks my 
                        language!" she says. "I can preach God's Word, and everyone 
                        can understand right away."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Her favorite verse is John 15:7, "But if you remain in me and my 
                        words remain in you, you may ask for anything you want, and it 
                        will be granted!" (NLT)
                    </p>
                    <p>What has God given Caritina that she asked for? In a community 
                        where men are known for alcohol abuse, her husband and 
                        seven sons have all accepted Christ. And each of her sons married 
                        Christian women.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        "I wanted to see all our family in front of a church worshiping 
                        God, and God did it," she says. "He is bringing transformation in 
                        my community."
                    </p>

                    <h1>A TIME TO LOVE</h1>
                    <h3>By Barbara Coots</h3>
                    <p>
                        Israel Santiago's world changed the moment he saw Silvia 
                        Guerra. It was summer 2012, and they were both 17. He was 
                        helping to lead a summer Bible study for children, teens and 
                        young adults when a group of girls walked in.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        "All of a sudden, I focused on her," he recalls. "And I thought, 
                        Oh, Lord. Oh, God."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        That Song-of-Solomon moment ended quickly as Israel shyly 
                        tried to hide behind a speaker cabinet. But Silvia saw him.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        "I also sensed something special," she says.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Little did either of them know that their looming romance also 
                        would lead them into Bible translation work together.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Israel and Silvia were both Christian workers from the Oaxacan 
                        region of Mexico that includes Juchit&agrave;n de Zaragoza, Israle's 
                        hometown. That summer, they got acquainted, but that was 
                        about all.
                    </p>
                    <img src="imgs/israel&silvia/TSCOMexico_i&s_2.jpg" />
                    <p>The following summer, Israel got an assignment to direct a 
                        three-day class near Silvia's hometown, Alvaro Obregon. He remembered 
                        Silvia and requested that she be approved as a translator 
                        for the Spanish-speaking teachers and Zapotec students. 
                        She was, and she accepted.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        At the end of the third day, he declared his feelings for her. He 
                        included the words, "if it is God's will." To her, that set him apart 
                        from other suitors she had easily dismissed.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        "We both were praying to the Lord to guide us, and to have a 
                        spouse who would be devoted and serving God," Israel says.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        They married last year at age 20. Today they serve on the team 
                        that is translating the Old Testament into Zapotec, their mother 
                        tongue. Even before they heard of the project, they had drafted 
                        translation of Psalms, 25 chapters of Proverbs ... and the Song 
                        of Solomon. The poetic love verses have enriched their first 
                        year of marriage.
                    </p>
                    <img src="imgs/israel&silvia/TSCOMexico_i&s_3.jpg" />
                    <p>
                        In the lyrical language of Zapotec, "It is the daily way of a man 
                        talking to a woman," Israel says.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The Zapotec language is rich in metaphors, and the poetic 
                        books resonate with the people. Israel says when he hears Proverbs 
                        in Zapotec, "it is as if I am listening to my grandfathers."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Israel and Silvia celebrated their first anniversary in April.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        "There is a Bible verse that stood out to us from the beginning," 
                        Silvia says. "Ecclesiastes 1:3. 'There is a time for everything.'"

                    <h3>By Barbara Coots</h3>
                    <p>
                        For 35 years, Rosalino Antonio ran from God.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        He liked his lifestyle, drifting from bar to bar in the Mexican 
                        town of Juchit&agrave;n de Zaragoza, just about every night. 
                        Sometimes he came home. Sometimes he stayed overnight 
                        with his drinking buddies.
                    </p>

                        The Christian men in his family tried to reason with Rosalino. 
                        One day, his brother-in-law said, "Do you know God? Do you 
                        know who He is?"
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        "Yes, I know God. You know the same God that I know," 
                        Rosalino said.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In reality, that word &mdash; god &mdash; had little meaning to him. 
                        It brought thoughts of ancient Zapotec customs and 
                        worshiping statues.

                        God's pursuit continued. Local church members came to 
                        his home. His mother-in-law invited him to church. His 
                        father-in-law took him to a revival.

                        Then one day, a different visitor knocked on his door. It was 
                        Pedro, an old friend from the bars who had experienced a 
                        big life change. Pedro began telling Rosalino about Jesus.

                    <p>
                        "I recognized what he was doing &mdash; sharing the Word of 
                        God with me," Rosalino recalls. "I said, 'Don't tell me you are 
                        with those evangelicals now!"
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But for three months, Pedro continued visiting, sharing truth 
                        from the Bible. During that time Rosalino continued to get 
                        invitations to church. Somtimes he would go.

                    <p>
                        Finally, after attending a service with his father-in-law, 
                        Rosalino reluctantly decided to attend church on his own. 
                        When the pastor made an altar call, he walked forward. 
                        A colorfully-dressed elder prayed for him.

                    <p>
                        That day, Rosalino stopped running.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        "I understood there is a real God who has a purpose for my 
                        life," he says.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Today, Rosalino works as a tailor in Juchit&agrave;n do Zaragoza, 
                        Oaxaca. He serves as a deacon in his church ... and is an 
                        enthusiastic supporter of Bible translation for his Zapotec 
                        people.

                        "In the beginning, when I read the Bible in Spanish, I couldn't 
                        comprehend," he says "I felt I didn't deserve to be forgiven. 
                        But when I read Romans 3:23 in my language, I understood 
                        God's grace. Even though we are sinners, He loves us. It was 
                        then that I found full life in Jesus."
